# Stub generation system
#
# This is a cleanup/partial rewrite of the older stub generation script. See the readme for details
# on how to operate this script, with GEN_INTERFACE macros in CVR files. Also read the README first
# for an (rather bare-bones) introduction to the header splitting system.
#
# Each interface (IVRSystem, IVRCompositor, etc) has a version number. Each time Valve modifies
# that interface they increment the version number. When the application runs it asks for a specific
# version of a given interface, so Valve doesn't have to maintain ABI compatibility across everything.
#
# This means we have IVRSettings_001, IVRSettings_002 and so on. We obviously don't want to duplicate
# all our code like that, so we write one 'base' class (BaseSettings) with all the methods from every
# version of the IVRSettings interface. We then only need tiny version-specific classes that delegate all
# their functions to BaseSettings.
#
# Writing these classes by hand would be very annoying, particularly for interfaces like IVRSystem and
# IVRCompositor which have well over 20 versions each. Leaving out a function would lead to hard
# to find runtime issues, and it would be a lot of work to add support for a new version of an interface, which
# is relatively frequent (especially a few years ago when they came out far more often than they do now).
#
# Thus the purpose of this script is to parse the already-split interface header files and generate the
# version-specific 'stub' classes that forward everything to the BaseXYZ class. For each interface the
# user lists all the versions available in the 'CVR' (can't remember how it got that name) file for an
# interface, such as CVRSettings. This is a valid C++ file, but special macros (which expand to nothing
# during preprocessing but are parsed by this script) can be used to control the stub generation.

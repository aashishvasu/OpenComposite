Download https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-sdk-for-windows/ and extract it into this directory.
This directory should contain a single directory named 'OculusSDK'.

You should probably be fine with the latest version, but for reference the version used during development was 1.20.0

After that, open it in Visual Studio and build LibOVR and LibOVRKernel
